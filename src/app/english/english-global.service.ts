    <h1>Dravida Brahmana Ravana Brahma</h1><br>
  </ion-col>
</ion-row>
    <p>
    Ravana Brahma was also known as the Adi(Dravida)Brahmana, Dravideshwara, AparaBrahma(highest yogi who had the highest yoga power) was Yogeeswara, who had the knowledge of past, present & future, knowledge of three Souls, knowledge of three Yogas, knowledge of Complete Spiritual wisdom,and was highly intelligent in various fields and Shastras. He was the Bhagavan, unattached to the three qualities of Nature, born as a first child to Visravasa and Kaikasi in Sri Lanka during Thretha Yuga (Thraitha Yoga). 
    <br><br>
    Ravana Brahma was not an ordinary person. He was a Supernatural and Divine Power. Ravana Brahma's birth was a big secret. There was divine power, Atma Shakthi inside the Great Indian (Indu) Ocean around Sri Lanka. That divine power wanted to show to the human kind that how to develop interest in spiritual study, what is 'divine knowledge' on earth? What is 'yoga'? And at last, what is "Salvation/Moksha'? To set an example for the people on the earth and to give direct evidence about Divine Wisdom, Yoga, path of Salvation, that Divine power itself has taken birth as Ravana Brahma, a true representative of Brahma Vidya Shastra. So, there is no involvement of father and mother in his birth. In this way that power has been called as Brahma. At last, according to Brahma Vidya conditions only, he died and attained salvation. From this we can understand that Ravana Brahma was not an ordinary person, but a very great person with invisible divine power and became a role model for spiritual enlightenment, self-realization (Yoga) and showed ways & means to humanity for attaining liberation. But, people could not realize the greatness and objective of Ravana Brahma's birth. 
    <br><br>
    Ravana was his name and Brahma was an award, title of honour. According to spiritual knowledge, the only meaning for Brahma is "biggest". In this world nobody is bigger than GOD. So the word Brahma is surname of GOD. The person who by virtues is called 'Brahma' is like a GOD or is equivalent to 'Eshwara'. If the word 'Ravana' is split into two, it will be Ra+Vana. The word 'Vana' means forest i.e. it means full of trees. 'Ra' means destruction. The meaning for the word 'Ravana' is that the person who destroys the forest (Maya). In detail, Maya is compared as forest and Gunas as trees, the person who destroys Gunas (trees) in Maya (forest) is called as Ravana. During that time, as he was the leader in destroying completely the Maya (forest), he was called as Ravana Brahma. 
    <br><br>
    Ravana was famous as a great intellectual in various fields and sciences like Brahma Vidya Shastra (Super science), Astrology, Politics, Ayurveda, Music etc... Ravana's IQ (Intelligence Quotient) & Spiritual Power were equal to the IQ of ten intelligent persons. 
    So, elders by their wisdom, during that time, as an honour and respect, used to call him as à¥‘Ten headed' or Dasa Kanta. That did not mean that he was having ten heads, physically. But from one aspect, Dasa headed is correct with regard to his magnificent 1Q and he was having one head only. 
    <br><br>
    During Thraitha Yoga (Thretha yuga), Ravana Brahma was the only person who knew that the Great Indian (Indu) Ocean is filled with Divine Power. So, he frequently used to have bath in that ocean. At that time he only knew that if taken bath in "Indu Maha Samudra/Indian Ocean", that Divine power will enter into person's body. In those days there was so much power in the Indian Ocean. But, today that power is not there. Ravana Brahma, being a great spiritual person, also called as Trikala jnani, named the Ocean as "Indu" Ocean as a symbol of Divine Knowledge and even after his death made his "Atma Shakthi" to remain in Indu Ocean. Later on, after many years passed by, the country name "Indu" was changed as "Hindu" and even the Ocean name changed as "Hindu", which made Ravana Brahma's Atma Shakthi to leave this Indian Ocean and shift to Atlantic Ocean, near America in Kali Yoga. The Ravana Brahma's Spiritual Power, which knew about the "Doctrine of Three Souls", i.e., "Jeevatma, Atma, Paramatma", had spread as "Triangular Shaped Field" named today as "Bermuda Triangle". Ravana Brahma's life throughout from birth to death represented an authentic model for 'Brahma Vidya Shastra' and remained as guidance for all the living beings. That Divine Power still exists now as Spiritual Power, living power, Triangular shaped field Power, near Florida, as "Bermuda Triangle". This Bermuda triangle which is present now at a place in the North of Atlantic Ocean, is centre for all pervading 5 Bhuthas(5 Elements), Grahas, upagrahas, upabhuttas (like Clouds, Diseases).The Spiritual Power from the Bermuda Triangle is giving vital energy to all these parts of Nature (Prakruthi,) which are spread all over the Earth, to make and do all respective works in respective places at respective times. 
    <br><br>
    "Eshwara' means the Owner/Head/Lord. Ravana Brahma worshipped the Supreme Lord of the whole Universe, i.e., Omnipresent, ParaBrahman, Purushotthama, in the form of "Eswara Linga". In order to guide all mankind in the right path, he himself worshipped and revealed the way of worshipping Eswara Linga .But he never performed pujas to Demi gods (Anya Devatha) and even strongly refuted those kinds of worships. He used to be always in (Karma) Yoga, but never performed meditations. 
    <br><br>
    In Thraitha Yuga, people who consume "Sura", an alcoholic drink, were called as "Suras". And who did not consume "Sura", an alcoholic drink, were called as Asuras. As Ravana Brahma did not have any bad habits, he was called as "RavanaAsura" by the wise elders. But Aryans who had enmity with Ravana Brahma have intentionally misinterpreted the meaning of the word 'Asura' as 'Rakshasa(Demon)'! Unfortunately, most of the people believed it as true. Ravana was born in a great genealogy/family and was called as "Paulasya Brahma". He was the real Dravida Brahmana, who possessed the Knowledge of Supreme Lord, ParaBrahman. So, how he can be a Rakshasa?   
    <br><br>
    The major cause for the seve enmity between Ravana Brahma and Aryans was, Dravideshwara strictly refuted the Aryans, who encouraged the practices of 4 Adharmas (Performing yagnas, chanting of Vedic Mantra, Meditations, Charities/Donations, which provides better comforts in the coming births but not salvation) and even obstructed & spoiled those practices. He encouraged the practice of 3 Dharmas(Karma Yoga, Brahma Yoga, Bhakthi Yoga, which eliminate Karma and pave path for salvation). Ravana Brahma knew that as per Brahma Vidya Shastra (Super Science), the practice of 4 Adharmas are against to path of Salvation/ Moksha, while the practice of 3 Dharmas lead to the Salvation. So, for strongly refuting Adharmas, Ravana Brahma was propagated badly by Aryans. Ravana Brahma, who opposed the attempts of Aryans to vitiate "Divine Knowledge" as they were trying to introduce unrighteous acts, i.e., Adharmas (Study of Vedas, performing Yagnas, meditations, Charities/donations) and also as he declared those acts as Adharmas, it makes us to understand that he was the Bhagavan of Thraitha Yoga(Threta yuga), who came to set right the daiva gnanam which was vitiated by Aryans. 
    <br><br>
    The people who have "Brahma Gnana" (Divine Knowledge) must be called "Brahmans". Anyone can be called Brahmana if they possess brahma Gnana, but Brahman caste never existed among the castes. The people who have the knowledge of 3 Souls, i.e., Kshara, Akshara and Purushottama can be called Dravida Brahmans. Similarly the people who have the knowledge of Vedas and Yagnas can be called Arya Brahmins. Ravana, who had complete Divine Knowledge, was a pure Brahmin. Being a king, he tried as lead the Dravida Brahmans that the devotion to (Supreme) God and knowledge of Brahma Vidya Shastra and its power should not diminish in the Dravida Brahmans. He kept a watch on his people and supervised the Dravida Brahmans to see that they would not move out from the knowledge of 3 Souls and always be with the Power of God's Wisdom. Even diseases were afraid of Dravida Brahmans. No diseases prevailed in Sri Lanka or its surroundings. Ravana Brahma, being an incarnation of God, converted his Intellect strength into Mantra Power and made "Pushpaka Vimana", an Aeroplane, He utilized it to spread the God's Wisdom to all people in various places on the Earth. 
    <br><br>
    Thus, as entire South India was under the command of Dravida Brahmana leader, Ravana Brahma. Everyone used to follow the Spiritual knowledge and had the power of wisdom. The followers of Ravana Brahma used to obstruct and spoil the Yagnas, 
    when ever any person tried to do Yagnas for fulfilling their desires. Even, the Grahas of space, which are the lords of Yagnas used to support the followers of Ravana ENGLISH Brahma only, without obstructing them in any manner whatsoever. Ravana Brahma and his soldiers used to obstruct anyone whoever was practicing Adharmas with the Aryans support and encouragement. Lankeshwara appeared like "Yama" for Aryans. In South India, Aryans tried to increase their strength & supremacy, used to do vastly Yagnas and Vedic chanting. In that course of time, for the protection of Yagna, Viswamitra took Rama with him. Being a child, without having any knowledge of Brahma Gnana (Divine Wisdom), Rama went for Yagna protection and unjust fully killed the followers of Ravana, who obstructed this Adharma. The enmity between Aryans and Dravidians which existed even before Rama's birth had became very severe after this incident. These are the true facts, which did not find place in history books! 
    <br><br>
    The Ramayana epic in the form of book was written by Valmiki, an Aryan, had described Ravana as a bad and wicked person. It is a fact that Ravana had taken Sita to Sri Lanka. If we talk about him without knowing his intention of taking away Sita to Sri Lanka, it can be said that we have also lost the discretionary power. Ravana, who had free will of his death, having the knowledge of past, present and future being Trikala Gnani, knew that his death is in the hands of Aryan, Rama. So, for that to happen, he informed this to his wife, Mandodari and that to happen Sita should be brought to Lanka. Keeping this matter aside intentionally, Aryans propagated badly about Ravana that with wicked intention he had taken away Sita to Sri Lanka. Ravana, having age more than 80 (Eighty years) at that time, was an intelligent and experienced man. He made arrangements for Sita by appointing twenty maids for her service, keeping her 50 km away from his residence, at a park in the midst of cascades in a good environment. Ravana used to visit Sita's place Le, Ashoka forest every week along with his wife and used to accord daughterly treatment to Sita and used to enquire about her health and used to order the servants to look after her very carefully. Ravana informed Sita about future events Le, Rama would come here for him and he even told about his death time to Sita. He also told in advance that she will come to know what type person Rama is. As Ravana provided a fatherly treatment to Sita, she recognized Ravana as a yogi and Gnani(Wise man) and never spoke bad about him or blamed him any time. In fact when she was in hermitage of Valmiki in the forest without having any facilities and comforts for 11 years and facing so many difficulties, she remembered and thought that she lived more happily in Sri Lanka, than in the Valmik's hermitage. Sita never told anything bad against Ravana, but as Aryans wrote Ramayana book, so narrated him as a bad person. Actually, Ravana was a Brahma Gnani who spent spotless life. Being an Astrologer (Kala Jnani) & clairvoyant, who knew about happenings future, being a Yogeeswara, having free will death', does not know about morality-justice, wisdom-righteousness (Dharma)? Without recognizing Ravana Brahma's greatness at that time, Aryan poets with regional differences and enviousness, had finally portrayed him bad, ignorant, wicked, demon and lustful person and propagated it. Even today also everyone is talking in the same way, neither applying their brain and nor pondering into details. Scholars, illiterates, Intellectuals, fools, all are considering Ravana Brahma as much inferior to normal human being.  
    <br><br>
    Because of this, the Spiritual power inside the Ocean got furious on the ignorance of human kind for insulting Ravana Brahma, in an unfair way, and so left Indian (Indu) Ocean and shifted to the Atlantic Ocean near America and got named as "Bermuda Triangle", triangular shaped power, causing accidents, hijackings etc., whoever is crossing the powerful triangular area. It is sending some people to other planets to learn Divine knowledge. But not doing any harm to wise persons (Gnanis) by safeguarding and ensuring their safe passage. Clouds, which play an important role in God's governance, touch this Triangular shaped power and gain invisible and mysterious power. After crossing over and touching this Triangular shaped power', getting stimulated, clouds are influencing their power upon the living beings on the Earth. This Divine Power cannot be explained by any material science. Only, Super Science (Brahma Vidya Shastra) can give correct explanation. 
    <br><br>
    On that day all the people in Sri Lanka were aware of the Divine Wisdom and didn't have demonic nature. As all people were wise, before the name of the country Lanka, the auspicious letter "Sri" was added calling Sri Lanka. Sri means Salvation/Moksha. Even today in Sri Lanka, the descendants of the citizens of Ravana Brahma's reign, are living. They speak pure Telugu language with Sinhala accent. They are counted as nomads, in Sri Lanka, but it is a truth. Even today they tell that during the reign of Dravidian king Ravana all people used to speak Telugu Ravana also used to talk in Telugu language only. So, if research is made impartially about Ravana's history, we can get proved about the great personality of Ravana and also Telugu language's ancientness and its greatness among all the languages, having biggest script. These Telugu speaking nomadic people in Sri Lanka, even today also worship Ravana Brahma. They are not accepting him as a Demon/Rakshasa. We too agree and support their claim. In the beginning of the Creation, God taught Divine Wisdom to Sun. That Knowledge was preached to Manu through Sun. Later from Manu, it had spread to all over the World. That Divine knowledge was completely and perfectly practiced only by Ravana Brahma, Unable to tolerate this, Asians (Aryans) with envy, portrayed Ravana as a Demon/Rakshasa! Even today there are Telugu people in Sri Lanka, who regard and honour Ravana Brahma as a man of righteousness, who fought battle righteously, and also strongly believe that he did not die, but got injured and are of the opinion that Ravana would come alive at any time. Also, they claim that in the Rama-Ravana battle, no monkeys, no bears or any other animals participated and they have relevant proofs regarding Asians (Aryans) conspiracy, in misinterpreting and vitiating the history. 
    <br><br>
    In the ancient India, the race living in the whole country was counted as Dravidians only, taking historical basis as proof. But after some time, central Asians migrated to our country in search of livelihood due to occurrences of famines in their native regions. So, those Asians, who came to India for livelihood, later with deceit, wickedness, and violence, forcibly grabbed the kingdoms (with encroachment) of the innocent Dravidians, who were wise in Divine knowledge and naÃ¯ve to worldly affairs. These invaders are today referred as Aryans. Because of the entry of the Aryans, Dravidians lost their autonomy (independence), gone far away to their Spiritual Knowledge, became victims to Asians deceiving tricks and thus Adharma practices were enforced on them. Due to this, gradually, Dravidians lost their existence and reached the stage of loss of hope and forgotten that they were Dravidians. 
    <br><br>
    The people, who were the descendents of the citizens during Ravana Brahma's Government, presently living in Sri Lanka, which was an interior part of the Dravida country (Desha), believe that any day, Ravana Brahma will come back as he does not have death and will come back to establish the God's Dharma (righteousness).We are also of the firm opinion that he is present now as the Spiritual power and Triangular shape power (in the Bermuda Triangle),takes Avatar to re-establish the Dharmas, he is not Jeevatma, so he has no death. To bring to light, the forgotten truth that, Ravana Brahma was not ignorant but he was a man with Complete Divine Wisdom (Daiva Gnani), he was not evil but a good person, he was not Sudra but a true Sath-Brahmana and he was not an ordinary man, but he was Avatar of God, Bhagavan, Yogeeswara !
